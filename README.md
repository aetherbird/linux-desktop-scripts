## Simple Scripts for Linux Desktop

This is the repository for default scripts and commands to be used on the Linux desktop.  These scripts use rofi to select currently open windows, instead of re-launching new processes.  These scripts can then be mapped to hotkeys in your Linux desktop environment.  This prevents opening new tabs and windows that are redundant, and allows for better productivity and memory management.
